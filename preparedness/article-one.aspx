        <h3>Education and Opportunity</h3>
        <p>The educational opportunities we provide our children and young adults are closely tied to changes in the economy, the nature of work, and the skills now needed in broad sectors of the workforce (Autor, 2019; Engler, et al., 2018; World Economic Forum, 2015). In the United States during the 20th century, advances toward compulsory K&ndash;12 education and policies to open postsecondary education to the broader population were integrally tied to manufacturing advancements and the emergence of new service and white collar sectors in part connected to these (Goldin &amp; Katz, 2009; Levy &amp; Murnane, 2012). In the 2000s, rates of U.S. public high school graduation, overall college enrollment, and educational attainment at all levels have increased along with an accompanying rise in employment for knowledge-intensive and some service-oriented occupations requiring higher levels of social or analytical skills, as well as higher levels of education, training, and experience (Irwin et al., 2021; Pew Research Center, 2016). With rapid advances in technology reshaping the workplace, more U.S. workers are viewing education, ongoing training, and skills development as essential to their career success (Pew Research Center, 2016).</p>
        <p>Data collected by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) indicate that more students than ever in the United States are graduating from high school and enrolling in postsecondary education. In 2018-19, the adjusted cohort graduation rate was 86 percent&mdash;7 percentage points higher than in 2010-11 (Irwin et al., 2021). Furthermore, in 2019, sixty-six percent of recent high school graduates immediately enrolled in postsecondary education (22 percent in two-year colleges and 44 percent in four-year colleges) (Irwin et al., 2021). Despite these positive findings, data from both international and national surveys reveal that while more young adults are graduating from high school and enrolling in college, not all may be doing so with the skills necessary to complete these postsecondary education endeavors (Goodman et al., 2015). In 2019, the overall retention rate for first-time, full-time degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered four-year degree granting institutions in the previous fall was 81 percent and the overall six-year graduation rate for first-time full-time undergraduate students who began seeking a bachelor's degree at four-year degree-granting institutions was 63 percent (Irwin et al., 2021). Data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies indicate that although a greater percentage of young adults in the United States are attaining higher levels of education since 2003, the numeracy scores of millennials whose highest level of education is high school and above high school have declined (Goodman et al., 2015). In addition, results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which provides nationally representative data on student achievement in reading and mathematics over time, show that the average reading score for twelfth-graders in 2019 was lower than those recorded in the previous assessment year (2015), a decade ago (2009), and the first assessment year (1992) (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2020). Progress in mathematics has also declined or stalled&mdash;the average NAEP grade 12 mathematics score in 2019 was lower than in 2009 and was not significantly different from those recorded in 2015 and 2005 (NCES, 2020). These findings raise important questions about young adults' level of academic preparedness and acquisition of knowledge and skills as they enter and move through the postsecondary education system.</p>
        <p>In this article, we further this discussion by more closely examining achievement and survey data from the large, nationally representative sample of twelfth-grade students who participated in the 2019 NAEP reading assessment. First, we examine NAEP achievement data to shed light on the relationship between what students know and can do and academic preparedness. Then, we dig deeper into NAEP survey data to describe relationships between contextual factors (specifically, students' postsecondary plans, college knowledge, and noncognitive factors) and academic preparedness. The descriptive results of this initial investigation serve as the basis for further study of the relationships between academic preparedness and student achievement gaps, which will be explored in a companion article.</p>

        <h3>NAEP Achievement and Academic Preparedness</h3>
        <p>A series of <a href="https://www.nagb.gov/focus-areas/reports/preparedness-research.html">studies conducted by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB)</a>, which oversees the NAEP assessments, has shown that performance on the twelfth-grade NAEP reading and mathematics assessments provides a meaningful and reliable benchmark for understanding whether students are academically prepared for postsecondary education (National Assessment Governing Board, n.d.). In the current article, we focus on academic preparedness in the context of the NAEP grade 12 reading assessment. Note that the NAEP reading scale ranges from 0 to 500. The cut score of 302 represents the minimum score required for performance at the <em>NAEP Proficient</em> level on the NAEP grade 12 reading assessment. The NAGB studies have found that twelfth-graders scoring at or above 302 on the NAEP reading assessment also possess the knowledge and skills in reading needed to be academically prepared for entry-level college coursework without the need for remedial courses. In 2019, only 37 percent of grade 12 students in the nation demonstrated knowledge and skills in reading at or above the <em>NAEP Proficient</em> level&mdash;reflecting solid academic performance and competency over challenging subject matter. (For information about academic performance and competency in reading and the NAEP achievement levels, see the next section "Learn more about the knowledge and skills in reading demonstrated at each NAEP achievement level.") These results provide further evidence that many twelfth-graders in the United States may not possess the knowledge and skills in reading needed to succeed in the postsecondary education system.</p>

        <p>Consider, for example, twelfth-graders performing at the <em>NAEP Proficient</em> level in reading, which ranges from a score of 302 up to 346 (the cut score for <em>NAEP Advanced</em>). In 2019, twelfth-graders performing at the lower end of the <em>NAEP Proficient</em> level with a score of 307 were likely to correctly answer a multiple-choice question that required them to recognize an idea that is supported by three separate informational sources.</p>
        <p>Twelfth-graders performing at the higher end of the <em>NAEP Proficient</em> level with a score of 341 were likely to correctly answer the above question that twelfth-graders with a score of 307 were likely to correctly answer, as well as:</p>

        <h3>Examining Contextual Indicators of Academic Preparedness in NAEP</h3>
        <p>While the acquisition of knowledge and skills is certainly important, there is growing recognition from researchers that contextual factors are also key to understanding students' preparedness for, and success in, the postsecondary education system (Borsato et al., 2013; Conley, 2008; Conley, 2014; Conley &amp; French, 2014; Duckworth et al., 2007; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019). For instance, students' academic preparedness and plans after high school may reflect, to some extent, variability in <em>college knowledge</em>&mdash;an understanding of the process of pursuing a college education and the mindsets and capabilities needed to navigate college success (Borsato et al., 2013; Nagaoka, 2018). This type of knowledge, shaped in part by socioeconomic and personal resources, can influence students' aspirations and preparations in high school, how they seek financial aid and pay for their postsecondary education, their persistence, and ultimately, their level of educational attainment (Nagaoka, 2018; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019). Researchers have also highlighted the positive relationship between <em>noncognitive factors</em>&mdash;skills, strategies, attitudes, and behaviors that are distinct from content knowledge and academic skills&mdash;and students' academic performance, high school completion, persistence in postsecondary education, and long-term outcomes, including their success in the job market (Almlund et al., 2011; Farrington et al., 2012; Heckman et al., 2006; Nagaoka et al., 2013; Richardson et al., 2012). In this article, we leverage NAEP survey data to examine relationships between these specific contextual factors and academic preparedness.</p>
        <p>As part of the 2019 grade 12 NAEP reading assessment, survey questionnaires were given to <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/subject/about/pdf/bgq/student/2019_sq_student_r_g12.pdf">students</a> and <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/subject/about/pdf/bgq/school-sdlep/2019_sq_school_rms_g12.pdf">school administrators</a> to collect information about students' learning contexts and experiences. This article analyzed students' responses to several survey questions. Some of the survey questions were selected as indicators of students' <em>postsecondary plans and college knowledge</em>. The remaining questions were selected as indicators of four types of <em>noncognitive factors</em> that researchers have previously identified as important for academic success: academic behaviors, learning strategies, academic perseverance, and academic mindsets (Farrington et al., 2012; Nagaoka et al., 2013). While some survey questions are reported here as standalone variables, others are combined into indices that measure individual underlying constructs or concepts. <a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reading/about/survey/?grade=12">Read more about the development of NAEP survey questionnaire indices</a>.</p>

        <p>To examine relationships between these contextual indicators and twelfth-graders' academic preparedness, we report two sets of results. First, we describe the percentages and average reading scores of twelfth-graders by their responses to these survey questions. Then, we describe the percentages of twelfth-graders who performed at or above the <em>NAEP Proficient</em> level by their responses to the survey questions. As previously noted, this is the NAEP achievement level with the same cut score as that of students identified as academically prepared for entry-level college coursework without the need for remedial courses.</p>
        <p>NAEP reports results using widely accepted statistical standards; findings are reported based on a statistical significance level set at .05, with appropriate adjustments for <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/tdw/analysis/2000_2001/infer_multiplecompare.aspx">multiple comparisons</a>. Only those differences that are found to be statistically significant are referred to as "higher," "lower," "larger," or "smaller."</p>

              <h4>Students' postsecondary plans and college knowledge</h4>
              <p><em>College knowledge</em>&mdash;an understanding of the process of pursuing a college education and the mindsets and capabilities needed to navigate college success&mdash;may contribute in part to variations in students' academic preparedness and paths after high school (Borsato et al., 2013; Nagaoka, 2018). This type of knowledge, shaped in part by socioeconomic and personal resources, can influence students' aspirations and preparations in high school; how they seek financial aid and pay for their postsecondary education; their persistence; and ultimately, their level of educational attainment.</p>
              <p>Given that college knowledge varies by students' backgrounds and school environments, interventions aimed at expanding this knowledge can be particularly vital for students from families without college experience (Conley, 2008). Research indicates that students' engagement in the college application process predicts college enrollment, especially for low-income or minority students, and applying for financial aid predicts college enrollment, particularly among low-income students (Lauff &amp; Ingels, 2013; Pallais &amp; Turner, 2006; Roderick et al., 2008).</p>
              <p>In this article, we examine NAEP survey questions related to students' postsecondary plans, which provide some indication of their college knowledge and intended paths after high school. In these survey questions, students reported (yes or no) the types of postsecondary planning they had done during the school year. While some  of the questions relate to their pursuit of additional education after high school (<em>i.e., taking the SAT or ACT college entrance exams; submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA; applying to a four-year college; applying to a two-year college; applying to a certificate or diploma program at a school that provides occupational training</em>), others relate to their pursuit of nonacademic paths, specifically entry into the workforce (<em>i.e., applying for a full-time job; talking with a military recruiter</em>).</p>
              <h4>Student noncognitive factors</h4>
              <p><em>Noncognitive factors</em>&mdash;skills, strategies, attitudes, and behaviors that are distinct from content knowledge and academic skills&mdash;have been found to be positively related to students' academic performance, high school completion, persistence in postsecondary education, and long-term outcomes, including their success in the job market (Almlund et al., 2011; Farrington et al., 2012; Heckmann et al., 2006: Nagaoka et al., 2013; Richardson et al., 2012). Five types of noncognitive factors have been shown to be related to students' academic success and align with behavioral, cognitive, and emotional dimensions of student engagement in learning: academic behaviors, learning strategies, academic perseverance, academic mindsets, and social skills (Appleton et al., 2008; Farrington et al., 2012; Fredricks et al., 2004; Nagaoka et al., 2013). In the 2019 grade 12 NAEP student questionnaire, students responded to survey questions capturing four of the five types of noncognitive factors. (Survey questions specifically related to social skills, or interpersonal qualities, are not included in the NAEP student questionnaire and are therefore not discussed in this article.)</p>
              <p><em>Academic behaviors</em> capture students' effort, attention, and participation in the schooling process (e.g., academic and extracurricular activities, coursetaking); the presence of positive conduct (e.g., school attendance, completion of school assignments); and the absence of negative conduct (e.g., tardiness, disruptive behavior) (Connell &amp; Wellborn, 1991; Finn, 1989; Finn &amp; Rock, 1997; Fredricks &amp; McColskey, 2012). For example, research has consistently documented a positive relationship between instructional time and learning, with chronic absenteeism (i.e., students' disengagement from instructional time) being a strong predictor of negative student outcomes (e.g., lower test scores, feelings of alienation, dropping out of school) at all grade levels (Aucejo &amp; Romano, 2016; Gottfried, 2014; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019; Smerillo et al., 2018). Enrollment in challenging, rigorous courses&mdash;such as Advanced Placement (AP)&mdash;can also be understood as a reflection of both behavioral and cognitive engagement in learning. However, students' enrollment in these types of advanced courses is dependent upon having the opportunity for more rigorous coursework available to them. Therefore, while enrollment in advanced coursework can be considered an indicator of students' cognitive and behavioral engagement and preparedness for postsecondary education, it also sheds light on disparities in preparedness by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status due to access factors that differentially impact schools or specific groups of students within a school (Gamoran, 1987; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019; Oakes, 1985).</p>
              <p>In this article, we examine academic behaviors using NAEP survey questions about students' <em>school attendance</em> and <em>AP coursetaking</em>. Students' school attendance is measured through their reports of how many days (<em>none, 1 or 2 days, 3 or 4 days, 5 to 10 days, more than 10 days</em>) they were absent from school in the last month. Students' AP coursetaking is measured through their reports of whether they were currently enrolled in or had taken an AP course in English Language and Composition or English Literature and Composition (<em>yes, no</em>).</p>
              <p><em>Learning strategies</em> encompass processes or approaches that are used to facilitate the cognitive work involved in acquiring content knowledge and skills. These strategies include study skills, metacognitive strategies, self-regulated learning, and goal-setting (Farrington et al., 2012). Effective strategies help students to leverage academic behaviors that maximize their learning, which can be particularly beneficial in the college context, in which learning is more individualized and self-directed and academic self-discipline is increasingly important (Nagaoka et al., 2013). Research has shown that the use of learning strategies is correlated with academic performance as well as perseverant behavior (Nagaoka et al., 2013).</p>
              <p>In this article, we examine learning strategies using a NAEP index of students' <em>academic self-discipline</em>. Twelfth-graders responded to four statements that capture their tendency to pay attention and stay on task when learning, such as "I paid attention and resisted distractions" and "I stayed on task without reminders from my teacher."  Students indicated how often they had performed the action described in each statement during the school year (<em>never or hardly ever, less than half of the time, about half of the time, more than half of the time, or all or almost all of the time</em>).</p>
              <p><em>Academic perseverance</em> broadly describes students' ability to remain focused and engaged in their schoolwork to the best of their ability despite distractions, obstacles, or challenges. This noncognitive factor reflects students' effort, motivation, and persistence in learning as well as the resulting quality of their academic behaviors (Farrington et al., 2012). Perseverance has been found to be one of the strongest predictors of academic achievement, success in higher education, and success in the workforce more generally (Heckman et al., 2006; Poropat, 2009; Richardson et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2007).</p>
              <p>In this article, we examine academic perseverance using NAEP indices of students' <em>persistence in learning, performance goals in reading,</em> and <em>mastery goals in reading</em>. For the index of students' persistence in learning, twelfth-graders responded to four statements that capture their tendency to persevere and work hard in the face of challenges, such as "I try very hard even after making mistakes" and "I keep working hard even when I feel like quitting."  Students indicated how much each statement described them (<em>not at all like me, a little bit like me, somewhat like me, quite a bit like me, or very much like me</em>).</p>
              <p>For the index of students' <em>performance goals in reading</em>, twelfth-graders responded to four statements that capture their motivation to show others that they do well in their English/language arts schoolwork and get better grades than others in their English/language arts class, such as "I want to show others that my English/language arts schoolwork is easy for me" and "I want to look smart in comparison to the other students in my English/language arts class."  Students indicated how much each statement described them (<em>not at all like me, a little bit like me, somewhat like me, quite a bit like me, or very much like me</em>).</p>
              <p>For the index of students' <em>mastery goals in reading</em>, twelfth-graders responded to four statements that capture their motivation to learn as much as they can and master new skills in their English/language arts class, such as "I want to learn as much as possible in my English/language arts class" and "I want to master a lot of new English/language arts skills in my class." Students indicated how much each statement described them (<em>not at all like me, a little bit like me, somewhat like me, quite a bit like me, or very much like me</em>).</p>
              <p><em>Academic mindsets</em> capture the attitudes, beliefs, and self-views that students possess in relation to academic work and their learning environment. Researchers point to academic mindsets as forming the foundation of academic perseverance, which results in academic behaviors that lead to academic success (Farrinton et al., 2012). Four key academic mindsets have been shown to enhance students' academic perseverance, academic behaviors, and academic performance: a sense of belonging to a community of learners; beliefs that academic ability can improve with effort; self-efficacy, or confidence in the ability to succeed in a given task; and the sense that a task at hand is interesting and holds value (Farrinton et al., 2012). Academic mindsets, particularly a sense of belonging, are important as students transition and adjust to unfamiliar academic and social environments in college (Walton & Cohen, 2007; Walton &amp; Spencer, 2009). Additionally, students' confidence in their knowledge and skills has been shown to be a strong predictor of performance and significantly related to positive academic outcomes, with these effects becoming stronger as students' progress from elementary school to high school and on to college (Multon et al., 1991).</p>
              <p>In this article, we examine academic mindsets using a NAEP index of students' <em>confidence in their reading knowledge and skills</em>. Twelfth-graders indicated their belief (<em>I definitely can't, I probably can't, maybe, I probably can, or I definitely can</em>) in their abilities to do 10 reading-related tasks, such as explaining the meaning of something they have read, judging the reliability of sources, and critiquing an author's craft or technique.</p>

        <h3>Students' postsecondary plans and college knowledge</h3>
        <p><span class="h-aside">Sixty percent of twelfth-graders plan to pursue additional education at a four-year college</span></p>
        <p>Results suggest that many students have knowledge of the process of pursuing a postsecondary education, and a majority applied to a four-year college. Over half of twelfth-graders in 2019 reported having completed plans related to pursuing additional education after high school. Specifically, 65 percent of grade 12 students reported they had taken the SAT or ACT college entrance exams, and 63 percent reported they had submitted the FAFSA.</p>
        <p>Students' survey responses also indicated variability in the types of postsecondary education that they planned to pursue, and that many students applied to multiple types of postsecondary education programs. Overall, 60 percent of grade 12 students reported they had applied to a four-year college. Of these students, 67 percent reported only applying to this type of institution. However, 24 percent reported also applying to a two-year college, 5 percent reported also applying to a certificate or diploma program that provides occupational training, and 5 percent reported also applying to both a two-year college and a certificate or diploma program. Overall, 32 percent of grade 12 students reported they had applied to a two-year college. Of these students, 38 percent reported only applying to this type of institution, 44 percent reported also applying to a four-year college, 8 percent reported also applying to a certificate or diploma program, and 9 percent reported also applying to both a four-year college and a certificate or diploma program. Finally, 12 percent of grade 12 students overall reported they had applied to a certificate or diploma program at a school that provides occupational training. Of these students, 29 percent reported only applying to this type of institution, 22 percent reported also applying to a two-year college, 25 percent reported also applying to a four-year college, and 24 percent reported also applying to both two-year and four-year colleges.</p>

        <p>Twelfth-graders who reported plans to pursue additional education after high school and specifically reported applying to a four-year college tended to score higher on average in reading than those who did not. There was a statistically significant 5-point reading score gap between students who did (288) and those who did not (284) report taking the SAT or ACT, significant 19-point gap between students who did (294) and those who did not (275) report submitting the FAFSA, and significant 29-point gap between students who did (299) and those who did not (270) report applying to a four-year college. On the other hand, students who reported applying to postsecondary education programs with lower admissions standards tended to have lower reading scores on average than those who did not. There was a statistically significant 17-point reading score gap between students who did (275) and those who did not (292) report applying to a two-year college and significant 24-point gap between students who did (266) and those who did not (290) report applying to a certificate or diploma program at a school that provides occupational training.</p>

        <p><span class="h-aside">Half of twelfth-graders who report applying to a four-year college perform at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em></span></p>
        <p>Examining students' postsecondary plans by NAEP achievement level provides further insight into what students know and can do as they prepare to enter the postsecondary education system. Results suggest that, while college knowledge can help students navigate the planning process, those who enter the postsecondary education system may be doing so without the knowledge and skills in reading that would further facilitate their success.</p> 
        <p>The NAEP achievement levels (<em>NAEP Basic</em>, <em>NAEP Proficient</em>, and <em>NAEP Advanced</em>) are performance standards that describe what students should know and be able to do in a given subject. Of the 65 percent of grade 12 students who reported taking the SAT or ACT, 40 percent performed at or above the <em>NAEP Proficient</em> level in reading; these students demonstrated solid academic performance and competency over challenging reading material. The remaining 60 percent performed below the <em>NAEP Proficient</em> level&mdash;that is, 33 percent performed at the <em>NAEP Basic</em> level denoting partial mastery of fundamental knowledge and skills in reading, and another 27 percent performed below this level. Additionally, of the 63 percent of students who reported submitting the FAFSA, 45 percent performed at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em> and 55 percent performed below this level (i.e., 32 percent performed at <em>NAEP Basic</em>, and 23 percent performed below <em>NAEP Basic</em>).</p>

        <p>As previously mentioned, 60 percent of grade 12 students reported applying to a four-year college. Of those students, 50 percent performed at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em> in reading while the remaining 50 percent performed below this level (i.e., 31 percent performed at <em>NAEP Basic</em>, and 19 percent performed below <em>NAEP Basic</em>). In other words, only half of the twelfth-graders who indicated applying to a four-year college demonstrated solid academic performance with reading skills such as locating and integrating information using sophisticated analyses, and supporting inferences, interpretative statements, and comparisons with specific text. Thirty-one percent of twelfth-graders who indicated applying to a four-year college were not able to demonstrate these skills, yet showed partial mastery of fundamental knowledge and skills in reading such as identifying elements of meaning and form in text; making inferences, interpretations, connections, and conclusions; providing some support for analyses in text; and interpreting the meaning of a word. Nineteen percent of twelfth-graders who indicated applying to a four-year college were not able to demonstrate any of the aforementioned reading skills.</p>
        <p>Among twelfth-graders who applied to educational programs with lower admissions standards, a smaller percentage of students performed at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em> than performed below. Specifically, of the 32 percent of grade 12 students who reported applying to a two-year college, 26 percent performed at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em>, and 74 percent performed below this level (i.e., 37 percent performed at <em>NAEP Basic</em>, and 37 percent performed below <em>NAEP Basic</em>). Moreover, of the 12 percent of students who applied to a certificate or diploma program at a school that provides occupational training, 20 percent performed at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em> and 80 percent performed below this level (i.e., 32 percent performed at <em>NAEP Basic</em>, and 47 percent performed below <em>NAEP Basic</em>).</p>
        <p>Half of grade 12 students taking actions to pursue additional education at a four-year college in 2019 did not demonstrate solid academic performance and competency in the NAEP reading assessment. Additionally, a large percentage of the students pursuing additional education at institutions with less rigorous admissions standards performed below the <em>NAEP Proficient</em> level in reading&mdash;74 percent of the students who reported applying to a two-year college, and 80 percent of the students who reported applying to a certificate or diploma program.</p>

        <p>While many twelfth-graders reported plans to pursue additional education after high school, a small percentage of students indicated they planned to pursue other postsecondary paths. Specifically, 17 percent of grade 12 students reported that they had applied for a full-time job and 26 percent reported that they had talked with a military recruiter. Students who reported these plans scored lower on average in reading than those who did not. There was a statistically significant 23-point reading score gap between students who did (268) and those who did not (291) apply for a full-time job and significant 9-point gap between students who did (280) and those who did not (289) talk with a military recruiter.</p> 
        <p><span class="h-aside">Most twelfth-graders reporting plans for nonacademic paths after high school demonstrate only partial mastery of fundamental reading knowledge and skills or less</span></p>
        <p>While one would expect a larger percentage of students planning nonacademic postsecondary paths to not meet academic preparedness standards, the results still raise concerns about the knowledge and skills that young adults possess as they enter the workforce directly after high school.</p>

        <p>Examining students' responses by NAEP achievement level reveals that among the 17 percent of grade 12 students who reported applying for a full-time job, 22 percent performed at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em> in reading and 78 percent performed below this level (i.e., 33 percent performed at <em>NAEP Basic</em>, and 45 percent performed below <em>NAEP Basic</em>). Additionally, of the 26 percent of students who reported talking with a military recruiter, 31 percent performed at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em> and 69 percent performed below this level (i.e., 36 percent performed at <em>NAEP Basic</em>, and 33 percent performed below <em>NAEP Basic</em>). In other words, among twelfth-graders who indicated plans for nonacademic paths after high school (i.e., applying to a full-time job or talking with a military recruiter), more than half were not able to demonstrate solid academic performance with reading skills such as locating and integrating information using sophisticated analyses, and supporting inferences, interpretative statements, and comparisons with specific text. Thirty-three percent of the twelfth-graders who indicated applying to a full-time job and 36 percent who indicated talking with a military recruiter showed only partial mastery of fundamental knowledge and skills in reading such as identifying elements of meaning and form in text; making inferences, interpretations, connections, and conclusions; providing some support for analyses in text; and interpreting the meaning of a word. Lastly, 45 percent of the twelfth-graders who indicated applying to a full-time job and 33 percent who indicated talking with a military recruiter were not able to demonstrate any of the aforementioned reading skills.</p>

        <p>In 2019, seventy-five percent of students reported that they were absent from school for no more than <em>1 or 2 days</em> in the last month. Students who reported being absent from school for fewer days in the last month had higher average reading scores than students who reported being absent for more days. For example, as shown in the figure above, there was a statistically significant 34-point reading score gap between students who reported being absent from school for no days (290) and those who reported being absent for <em>more than 10 days</em> (256).</p>

        <p>The percentage of students performing at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em> in reading tended to decrease as students reported being absent from school for more days.

On the other hand, of the 2 percent of students who reported being absent for more than 10 days, 15 percent performed at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em> and 85 percent performed below this level (i.e., 30 percent performed at <em>NAEP Basic</em>, and 55 percent performed below <em>NAEP Basic</em>).</p>

        <p><span class="h-aside">Positive relationship between twelfth-graders' learning-related strategies, perseverance, and mindsets and average reading scores</span></p>
        <p>Students' responses to survey questions that measure individual underlying constructs or concepts are combined into indices composed of <em>low, moderate,</em> and <em>high</em> categories. The category classifications are based on students' average responses to the survey questions in each index. For example, students with higher response averages (e.g., on average they responded closest to <em>very much like me</em> on questions with the response options <em>not at all like me, a little bit like me, somewhat like me, quite a bit like me,</em> or <em>very much like me</em>) tend to be classified as <em>high</em> on a given index, while students with lower response averages (e.g., on average they responded closest to <em>not at all like me</em>) tend to be classified as <em>low</em>.</p> 
        <p>Consistent with previous research on noncognitive factors and academic achievement, indices related to students' learning strategies, academic perseverance, and academic mindsets tended to be positively associated with students' average scores on the NAEP reading assessment. That is, students whose survey responses were categorized as <em>low</em> on a given index generally had lower reading scores on average than students whose responses were categorized as <em>moderate</em> or <em>high</em>. (For information about the indices reported in this article, see the previous section "Learn more about research on contextual indicators of academic preparedness and related survey questions from the 2019 grade 12 NAEP student questionnaire.")</p>

        <p>The reading score gaps between students in <em>high</em> and <em>low</em> index categories varied depending on the noncognitive factors measured. The figure on the right displays the average reading scores and score gaps between twelfth-grade students who were categorized as <em>high</em> and <em>low</em> in persistence in learning, academic self-discipline, and confidence in reading knowledge and skills, respectively. Notably, there was a statistically significant 67-point reading score gap between student responses categorized as <em>high</em> (297) and those categorized as <em>low</em> (230) in confidence in reading knowledge and skills. The large magnitude of this <em>high-low</em> score gap relative to those observed in the other indices is likely linked to the nature of the survey questions used to measure students' confidence in reading, which ask about specific tasks that are closely tied to the knowledge and skills measured in the NAEP reading assessment. It is also consistent with previous research highlighting task-specific academic self-efficacy as one of the strongest predictors of students' cumulative grade point average in college (Robbins et al., 2004).</p>
        <p><span class="h-aside">Of the 73 percent of twelfth-graders reporting high confidence in reading knowledge and skills, 47 percent perform at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em> compared to 53 percent who perform below this achievement level</span></p> 
        <p>Results show that the percentages of twelfth-graders performing at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em> in reading were larger among those who provided responses indicative of higher levels on a given index. Yet, among students whose responses were categorized as <em>high</em> on a given index, fewer than half performed at a level demonstrating solid academic performance and competency over challenging subject matter (<em>NAEP Proficient</em>). For instance, of the 38 percent of students whose responses were categorized as <em>high</em> in academic self-discipline, 43 percent performed at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em> in reading, and of the 20 percent of students whose responses were categorized as <em>low</em> in academic self-discipline, 27 percent performed at or above this level. The table below shows the percentages and NAEP achievement-level distributions of twelfth-grade students who were categorized as <em>low, moderate,</em> and <em>high</em> on indices related to students' learning strategies, academic perseverance, and academic mindsets. Thus, while noncognitive factors are positively related to twelfth-graders' performance on the NAEP reading assessment, many students whose responses are categorized as <em>high</em> on these factors still do not demonstrate sufficient knowledge and skills in reading to be considered academically prepared for entry-level college coursework.</p>

        <p>Conclusion</p>
        <p>Researchers have asserted that academic preparedness is a complex phenomenon that emerges from the interaction of academic, social, psychological, and background factors. While high school graduation rates have risen to 85 percent and the majority of graduates immediately enroll in 2- or 4-year institutions after high school (66 percent as of 2019), the findings here underscore that many of these students may not have the reading knowledge and skills they need to fully succeed in higher education (Irwin et al., 2021). The results also highlight the importance of examining contextual factors as indicators of students' preparedness for postsecondary education. Specifically, in this article we examined how twelfth-graders' postsecondary plans, college knowledge, and various noncognitive factors relate to their demonstration of knowledge and skills at or above the <em>NAEP Proficient</em> achievement level in reading, which is aligned with the NAGB definition of preparedness for postsecondary education.  Our analyses of survey data from a nationally representative sample of twelfth-grade students who participated in the 2019 NAEP reading assessment revealed the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>While a large proportion of students possess knowledge of the steps needed to enter the postsecondary education system, many may still be academically unprepared once they gain entry.</strong> Over half of twelfth-graders reported doing activities indicative of planning for additional postsecondary education (i.e., taking the SAT or ACT, submitting the FAFSA). Additionally, 60 percent of twelfth-graders reported applying to a four-year college. However, only half of these students performed at or above <em>NAEP Proficient</em> on the grade 12 reading assessment. Of the students who reported plans to pursue additional education at institutions with less rigorous admissions standards (i.e., two-year college, certificate or diploma program), the percentages performing below <em>NAEP Proficient</em> were larger than those performing at or above this level.</li>
          <li><strong>Most students pursuing entry into the workforce directly after high school demonstrate only partial mastery of fundamental reading knowledge and skills or less.</strong> Less than a quarter of twelfth-graders reported doing activities indicative of planning for nonacademic postsecondary paths (i.e., applying for a full-time job, talking with a military recruiter). Among students who reported plans to enter the workforce after high school, the percentages performing below <em>NAEP Proficient</em> were larger than those performing at or above this level. This suggests that many of these students may not be academically prepared for the postsecondary education system, and that they have not fully mastered fundamental knowledge and skills that could foster long-term career and wage growth as they enter the workforce.</li>
          <li><strong>Noncognitive factors&mdash;specifically, academic behaviors, learning strategies, academic perseverance, and academic mindsets&mdash;are related to twelfth-graders' academic achievement, but these factors do not guarantee academic preparedness.</strong> Twelfth-graders who reported fewer days absent from school or enrollment in AP English/language arts courses had higher average reading scores than those who reported more days absent or who did not take these courses. Additionally, students whose survey responses were categorized as <em>high</em> on the indices of persistence in learning, academic self-discipline, confidence in reading knowledge and skills, and performance and mastery goals in reading had higher average scores than those whose responses were categorized as <em>low</em>. Over half of students who reported taking AP English/language arts courses demonstrated knowledge and skills in reading at or above the <em>NAEP Proficient</em> achievement level. However, among the students with fewer school absences or whose responses were categorized as <em>high</em> on the previously mentioned indices, fewer than half performed at or above the <em>NAEP Proficient</em> level in reading. Strikingly, most twelfth-graders&mdash;almost three-quarters of them&mdash;reported survey responses that place them in the <em>high</em> category of confidence in their reading knowledge and skills, yet less than half of those students (47 percent) demonstrated sufficient knowledge and skills in reading to be considered academically prepared for entry-level college coursework in reading without the need for remedial courses.</li>
        </ol>   
        <p>It is important to note that, due to the cross-sectional design of NAEP, the survey data cannot be used to identify cause-and-effect relationships among these contextual factors and academic achievement or postsecondary preparedness. Future research could employ longitudinal methods to track the extent to which these various factors contribute to students' paths after high school, including their college enrollment, success in the postsecondary education system, and completion (Chen et al., 2017; Ingels et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>This article describes how several contextual indicators independently relate to grade 12 students' academic performance and preparedness. Because each indicator is analyzed and reported separately, the findings do not account for how these factors might collectively explain variations in students' academic performance and preparedness. Additionally, the 2019 NAEP grade 12 reading results reveal several persistent score gaps between student groups, which in turn suggest gaps in their academic preparedness. Further research is needed to examine the extent to which contextual indicators of academic preparedness vary by race/ethnicity and gender, as well as the extent to which students' contexts (i.e., academic, social, psychological, and background factors) might account for performance and preparedness gaps. A follow-up NAEP postsecondary preparedness article will examine this topic further using a regression analysis approach.</p>
        <p>Explorations of the role that contextual factors play in academic preparedness hold the potential to inform interventions, programs, and other opportunities to learn that can help improve college enrollment and completion outcomes. These efforts may particularly benefit students who aspire to attend college but lack the solid foundation of knowledge and skills to succeed in entry-level coursework. As Farrington and colleagues describe, such social investments in opportunities to learn and the development of noncognitive factors may "yield payoffs in improved educational outcomes as well as reduced racial/ethnic and gender disparities in school performance and educational attainment" (p. 5) (Farrington et al., 2012).</p>
