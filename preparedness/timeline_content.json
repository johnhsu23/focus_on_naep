The National Commission was charged with reviewing the 12th-grade assessment and developing recommendations to the Governing Board for improving it.", "more_details": "Low participation rates by schools and students in 2002 had raised serious concerns about the viability of 12th-grade NAEP. An important consideration by the National Commission was whether NAEP should continue to assess students at the 12th-grade level. "},

College Preparation and Grade 12 NAEP was presented to the Governing Board in September 2003. The report pointed to the problems and challenges that this endeavor would face, but it was generally supportive of the goal (Kirst, 2003)."},

The report, 12th-Grade Student Achievement in America: A New Vision for NAEP, called for a \"bold, new vision\" for 12th-grade NAEP (National Commission on NAEP 12th-Grade Assessment and Reporting, 2004, p.2). A key recommendation in the report was for NAEP to report on readiness of 12th-grade students for college, training for employment, and entrance into the military. The Governing Board accepted the National Commission's report and began considering the recommendations and how they could be implemented. ", "category": "", "more_details": "The National Commission affirmed that NAEP should continue to assess students in 12th-grade, and they proposed ways to increase the viability and validity of the assessment.The recommendation given highest priority was to expand state NAEP assessments from grades 4 and 8 to include grade 12. The National Commission recommended that school participation in the 12th-grade state NAEP be mandatory for reading and mathematics and voluntary in science and writing. This would provide more useful information about student achievement and increase interest and participation in the assessment of 12th-graders. Next in importance was the recommendation for NAEP to report on readiness of 12th-grade students for college, training for employment, and entrance into the military. Three additional recommendations included development of innovative strategies for increasing participation of high schools and students in 12th-grade NAEP and for motivating students to perform to their highest ability on the assessment; give prominence to 12th-grade NAEP performance in NAEP reporting; and continue the 12th-grade NAEP transcript studies and enhance them by expanding the information collected and improving the dissemination of results. (National Commission on NAEP 12th-Grade Assessment and Reporting, 2004). Each committee of the Governing Board would be involved in developing and implementing one or more recommendations of the National Commission, and each committee began discussing and planning how best to organize efforts to achieve the goals."},

Topic areas included validity procedures and preparedness standards for college, workforce and military preparedness.", "category": "", "more_details": "In Twelfth Grade NAEP as an Indicator of College Readiness: Validity Issues and Methodological Options, Andrew Porter (2004) analyzed several issues related to the high school-college transition and ways to evaluate the validity of preparedness research. He recommended that a single measure of preparedness for college-level work was likely to be inappropriate due to the difference between open admissions and highly selective institutions.<ol><li>William Alley (2005) outlined several alternative validity procedures in Twelfth Grade NAEP and Readiness for Entrance Into the Military: Validity Issues and Methodological Options. He noted that it would be necessary to establish empirical linkages between performance on the NAEP assessments by 12th-graders and measures of success in the military. He proposed and evaluated longitudinal, concurrent, and synthetic validation designs as approaches for research to establish the feasibility of using NAEP performance to predict preparedness for military service.</li><li>In Standard-Setting on Admissions Tests in Higher Education: The Uses of Admissions and Placement Tests by Selected Groups of Two- and Four-Year Colleges and Universities, Bob Laird (2004) analyzed the use of admissions and placement tests by two-year and four-year colleges and universities to determine the point at which individual colleges and universities deem entering students to be college-ready.</li><li>Neal Schmitt (2004) provided specific recommendations for how the Governing Board should develop measures of preparedness for workforce training. He noted in Readiness for Training Standards: Development and Validation that preparedness for workforce training measures would present several challenges for NAEP including: assessing noncognitive measures, involving training staff as content experts, and assessing non-academic knowledge, skills, and abilities, all of which would require significant changes to NAEP.</li><li>In Predicting Readiness for Military Service: How Enlistment Standards Are Established, W.S. Sellman (2004) described the Department of Defense enlistment testing program, specifically how applicants are screened and qualified for entrance and how new recruits are assigned to military occupations. He recommended the Governing Board consider establishing empirical linkages between NAEP and the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) to establish readiness for military service.</li>"},
